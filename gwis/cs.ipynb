    "# The Science Behind That Favorite Computer Games Of Yours\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Laptops and smartphones are essentially just pieces of circuits which communicate with each other by sending and receiving electronic signals. The only language they understand is binary which is composed of only two symbols, $1$ for \"on\" (usually one voltage) and $0$ for \"off\" (usually near ground potential zero voltage).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the computers to be useful, we need to give them instructions on what operations they must do and when. Technically, these instructions need to be streams of raw binary code, the only language that the hardware can understand. Fortunately, there have been a large number of amazing people who came up with designs for compilers which help us translate human-readable instructions to machine code. \n",
